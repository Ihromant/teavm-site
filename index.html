            <blockquote>
              <p>TeaVM is an ahead-of-time compiler of Java bytecode,
                  that's capable of emitting JavaScript and WebAssembly. Its close relative is well-known GWT.
                  The main difference is that TeaVM does not require to provide source code together with compiled class files.
                  Moreover, source code is not required to be Java, TeaVM successfully compiles Kotlin and Scala.
